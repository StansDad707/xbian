#XBian 1.0 Alpha 5 Changelog (Preview)
==================================
From the development point of view 
XBian 1.0 Alpha 5 took the most man
hours (we're awaiting feminine team
members). We've completely rewritten
xbian-config and created a custom
implementation for an animated splash.
We also welcomed a new team member 
specialized in python under the name
of belese (and sadly had to say 
goodbye to Hexagon). Belese worked
hard on a xbian-config port inside
XBMC. XBian can now be fully
customized inside XBMC. Last but not
least, we've finally included XBMC
v12 final.
